		<h1>DAD.</h1>
		<h2>Just got out of class.</h2>
		<p>It got off to a slow start, but it actually got exciting at certain parts, even in spite of the 2 hours! We went over:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The syllabus</li>
			<li>The general mentality of the class</li>
			<li>The basics on the software GitHub, which we'll be using throughout class</li>
			<li>Some starting blocks on using html, mostly certain labels and commands.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We made our own little websites primarily to answer a questionaire we cobbled together at the end. Even got to leave early due to a technical error! No homework due this week, which thank God; Comm stuff!</p>
		<p>This isn't even the extent of what tools we learned; some google-fu opens up the gammut a bit wider. I might actually make something of this!</p>
